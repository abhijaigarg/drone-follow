RGB camera based single human tracking
============

This is a python script that I wrote using the OpenCV library to track the movement of a human subject in a frame.

I wrote this script for my class at New York University "Experiments in Motion Capture" (http://movement.nyu.edu/mocap14s/)

The script uses a CV technique - meanshift to track the subject by recognising patterned shirts. Initialisation is done by face detection using the Haar Cascade detector.

The ultimate goal of this work is to enable drones to track human subjects and likewise follow them.
